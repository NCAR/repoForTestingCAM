#==============================
#config_cam_baseline.yaml

#This is the main CAM diagnostics config file
#for doing comparisons of a CAM run against
#another CAM run, or a CAM baseline simulation.

#Currently, if one is on NCAR's Casper
#machine, then only the CAM model data
#paths, case names, and model year spans
#are needed.  Running this diagnostics on
#a different machine, or with a different model,
#may require additional modifications.
#
#Config file Keywords:
#--------------------
#
#1.  Using ${xxx} will substitute that text with the
#    variable referenced by xxx. For example:
#
#    cam_case_name: cool_run
#    cam_climo_loc: /some/where/${cam_case_name}
#
#    will set "cam_climo_loc" in the diagnostics package to:
#    /some/where/cool_run
#
#2.  Using ${<top_level_section>.xxx} will do the same as
#    keyword 1 above, but specifies which sub-section the
#    variable is coming from, which is necessary for variables
#    that are repeated in different subsections.  For example:
#
#    diag_basic_info:
#      cam_climo_loc:  /some/where/${diag_cam_climo.start_year}
#
#    diag_cam_climo:
#      start_year: 1850
#
#    will set "cam_climo_loc" in the diagnostics package to:
#    /some/where/1850
#
#Please note that for both 1 and 2 the keywords must be lowercase.
#This is because future developments will hopefully use other keywords
#that are uppercase.
