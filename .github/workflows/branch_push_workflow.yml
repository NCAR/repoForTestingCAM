  #For some reason GitHub does not allow secrets
  #when a PR from a fork is closeed.  Thus instead
  #the workflow must activate whenever a commit
  #is pushed to the repo.  Theoretically this should
  #behave the same way as if triggered from a pull
  #request, just as long as no user ever pushes
  #directly to the repo.
